Pinax: a platform for rapidly developing websites
http://pinaxproject.com/

Pinax is an MIT-licensed, open-source platform built on the Django Web
Framework.

By integrating numerous reusable Django apps and providing starter projects
and infrastructure tools, Pinax takes care of the things that many sites
have in common so you can focus on what makes your site different.

Pinax has been used for everything from social networks to corporate websites
and from intranets to online games. We are also working on number of editions
tailored to event management, learning management, software project management
and more.


Most discussion about Pinax takes place on the IRC channel #pinax on
Freenode or the pinax-users mailing list on Google Groups.

ABOUT THE FRESH-START BRANCH

I (James Tauber) recently moved from one apartment to another in the same
complex. We had a two-week overlap where we had access to both places so
rather than move everything over at once, we moved things we most wanted
first, made sure they were set up and then moved on to the next thing.
Anything that needed replacing or we didn't want anymore, we left in the old
place until the last day when we threw it out.

The Pinax team are undertaking a very similar approach to getting Pinax ready
for 0.9 release. There are parts of Pinax that are mature and in production
use; there are parts that need cleaning up; and there are parts which need to
be replaced completely. Rather than doing all that in-place, we've set up a
new branch called fresh-start.

We've moving things over incrementally, starting with foundational starter
projects and only the pieces they need. This means that, early on, the
fresh-start branch will be pretty sparse (like my new apartment was the first
few days). But the stuff that's there will be production ready, or very close
to it, and will be reflective of the plans for the 0.9 release. This also
gives us an opportunity to do a better job of tests and documentation by
helping prioritize our time to the most important and stable parts of the
codebase.

If there's stuff in Pinax master that isn't in the fresh-start branch, it
could be that we simply haven't gotten to it yet. Or it could mean we're
deprecating its usage and plan an alternative approach in the new branch
(and hence 0.9). If in doubt, please ask us our plans.

We are in the process of setting up an alternative issue tracking system for
the fresh-start branch (which will still be based on Pinax). This will help
us focus on the code being prepared for release rather than sorting out
issues in code that will be discontinued anyway. We will keep you posted on
this new tracking system.
