Each of these will eventually link to a separate page for each starter project with:

* description
* what starter project itâ€™s built on
* what apps it uses (and perhaps particularly showcases)

# List of Starter Projects

Base of all starter projects:

* pinax-project-zero

Base for any site that has user accounts:

* pinax-project-account

Starter projects that need to be assessed and triaged:

* pinax-project-blog
* pinax-project-symposion
* pinax-project-lms
* pinax-project-forums
* pinax-project-social
* pinax-project-teams
* pinax-project-wiki
* pinax-project-static

Some starter projects just demo an app or collection of apps. Some provide scaffolding during the development and testing of an app. Some are full-featured, out-of-the-box sites. Some lay the foundation for almost any custom Django site.
