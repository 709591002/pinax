Silk Icons
==========

`Silk Icons`_ is a "smooth, free icon set, containing over 700 16x16 pixel icons
in strokably-soft PNG format".

Pinax ships with this icon set already so there is no need to download and add
it to your Pinax-based projects. You can `view all of the icons`_ in a single
image online for reference. There are two ways with which to use the set within
your project.


The Template Tag
----------------

Using the template tag is rather straight forward. Wherever you use the tag the
appropriate url to the icon will be rendered in an ``img`` tag::

    {% load theme_tags %}
    ....
    {% silk "stop" clsss="button" %}
    ....

This would result in::

    ...
    <img src="{{ STATIC_URL }}/pinax/img/silk/icons/stop.png" class="button" />
    ...


Using Sprites
-------------

If you are using a good number of these icons then you will be increasing the
number of requests the client needs to make to load the page, potentially
driving down performance. The classic way around this is to use `sprites`_ and
it just so happens that we now have silk sprites available in the the default
theme.

In order to use this, add this to your ``<head>`` block::

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ STATIC_URL }}pinax/css/silk.css" />

and then wherever you want an icon as a background image in a container you do
the following::

     <a class="ss_sprite ss_accept" href="http://pinaxproject.com">Django</a>

Where ``ss_accept`` is ``ss_`` plus the name of the icon as found in the
preview link.  Be sure to add ``ss_sprite`` on the block container you are hosting
the sprite object in.
