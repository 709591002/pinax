## Which starter project should I start with?

If you're wanting to build a new site with a combination of project-specific functionality and a few Pinax apps then you probably want to start with either the **Zero** starter project (if you don't have users logging in to your site) or the **Account** starter project (if you *do* have users logging in to your site).

## I've done the Quick Start and set up a project based on the Account starter project. Now what?

You can now start adding your own apps or existing Django apps (whether from Pinax or anywhere else).

## I already have an existing Django project. Can I still use Pinax?

A large component of Pinax is just re-usable Django apps. Most make very few assumptions about what else is in your project (although some assume you're using django-user-accounts for user account management). In most cases you can just use an app in the Pinax ecosystem like you would any other Django app.
