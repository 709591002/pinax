Getting started
===============

This guide is designed to point you to the best information about getting
started with Pinax. Pinax is built on top of Python and Django. We leverge
these technologies to their fullest. It is ideal you have some level of
experience with these tools before moving on. Here are some good first
resources if you need to learn about Python and Django:

 * **Python**: `Official Python tutorial`_
 * **Python**: `Dive into Python`_
 * **Django**: `Official Django tutorial`_
 * **Django**: `Official Django documentation`_

Those resources will be excellent reading material if you are not familiar
with Python or Django. The Django tutorial is especially important as many
core Pinax concepts are simply ones you find in Django.

.. _Dive into Python: http://diveintopython.org/

Prerequisites
=============

To get started with Pinax you must have the following installed:

 * Python 2.4+ — many OSes come with an adequate version of Python. If you are
   on Windows you will need to install it from `python.org`_. Do **not**
   install Python 3+. Pinax is not compatible with Python 3 yet.
 * `virtualenv`_ 1.4.7+
 * `pysqlite`_ — this is only required if you are running **Python 2.4**.
   Later versions of Python has this bundled.
 * :ref:`PIL <ref-pil>` — this is only required if you are using a project
   which requires imaging capabilites. It is likely the best idea to install
   it anyways.

Installation
============

Pinax highly encourges the use of virtual environments. We will use a tool
called `virtualenv`_ which provides a way to create isolated Python
environments.

.. note:: On virtual environments

    We promote per-project virtual environments. It will help you stay
    organized with dependencies for each project you build. You will see the
    name ``pinax-env`` used as the virtual environment name. We use this name
    as being the generic name for the environment, however, use something
    more appropriate to what you are building.

Create yourself a virtual environment and activate it::

    $ virtualenv pinax-env
    $ source pinax-env/bin/activate
    (pinax-env)$

If you use Windows this will become::

    $ virtualenv pinax-env
    $ pinax-env\Scripts\activate.bat
    (pinax-env)$

The directory ``pinax-env`` is the environment for your project. It is
recommended you do not edit or create new files/directories within it. The
reason this is important is that this directory should remain reproducible
at all times. Reproducible environments is a good idea.

Notice the ``(pinax-env)`` bit? This is done for you by the ``activate``
script to help you identify which environment is currently activated. Under
the hood your ``PATH`` has been modified to use the Python binary for this
environment.

Go ahead and install Pinax::

    (pinax-env)$ pip install Pinax

``pip`` you say? pip_ is a tool bundled with virtualenv to install Python
packages. It is super handy and it is used in Pinax extensively to handle
dependencies. You should become very familiar with this tool.

.. note:: ``pip install Pinax`` will fail

    This is a temporary note for readers of the 0.9 development version. The
    above will not work as-is at current time. You should instead run::
    
        (pinax-env)$ pip install --extra-index-url=http://dist.pinaxproject.com/dev/ Pinax

.. _virtualenv: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv
.. _pip: http://pip.openplans.org/

Pinax is now installed!


Creating a project
==================

Now that Pinax is installed the next step is to create a project. A project is
not much more than a Django project. Pinax provides many more defaults for you
out of the box.

::

    (pinax-env)$ pinax-admin setup_project myproject

This will create a new project named ``myproject``. By default it will install
dependencies for you. You can turn that behavior off by giving ``setup_project``
the ``--no-reqs`` option.

Pinax comes with many different project bases. The default project based is
what we call **layer zero**. It is simply a Django project with some extra
integrated dependencies that will make getting started faster.


Specifying a different project base
-----------------------------------

To see what Pinax has to offer run::

    (pinax-env)$ pinax-admin setup_project -l

This will list all available project bases and a short description about
each. To base your project off of any of these you'd run::

    (pinax-env)$ pinax-admin setup_project -b basic myproject

In many cases the default (``zero``) is enough to get you going, but others
may provide a better starting point for your project.


Running a project
=================

At this point you are now working with Django. Pinax has helped you bootstrap
your project into life. Inside your project you should run::

    (pinax-env)$ python manage.py syncdb
    (pinax-env)$ python manage.py runserver

``syncdb`` will create a SQLite database named ``dev.db`` in your current
directory. We've configured your project to do this, but you can change this
simply by modifying ``settings.py`` where ``DATABASES`` dictionary is
constructed. You can find more information about this at the `get your
database running`_ Django documentation.

.. _get your database running: http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/install/#get-your-database-running


What's next?
============

Look at our :doc:`customization <customization>` documentation to learn how you
might customize your project. If you are ready to deploy your project check
out the :doc:`deployment <deployment>` documentation.
