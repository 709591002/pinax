Pinax is an open-source platform built on the Django Web Framework.

By integrating numerous reusable Django apps and providing starter projects and
infrastructure tools, Pinax takes care of the things that many sites have in
common so you can focus on what makes your site different.

Pinax has been used for everything from social networks to conference websites,
and from intranets to online games.
