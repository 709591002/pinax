Download: <https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/p/pinax-theme-bootstrap/pinax-theme-bootstrap-2.0.1b1.tar.gz>

This release includes the following:

* 2.0.1b1
* have to hardcode paths for now, bug in less.js
* include less.js 1.2.2
* update to bootstrap 2.0.1
* I believe Bootstrap's docs says "help-block" should be <p>, not <span>. Now it'll work as it supposed to work.
* list -> nav-list (bootstrap 2.0 updates)
