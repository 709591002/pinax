This release includes the following:

* 0.1.2
* Drop Python 3 support for now
* Update README
* Prevent circular import path during test runs /  / I really hate doing this type of change. It's a smell that there is a better / way of structuring this code so that all imports can remain at the module / level
* Increase max line length
* Drop 2.6 support
* Fix setup.py
* 0.1
* Add site level integration extensions /  / This is done by the creation of Binder classes that are then added to a / list in settings.py called WIKI_BINDERS. We could probably do something / fancy like auto load all classes that inherit from wiki.binders.Binder / through a Metaclass registry or something but I think I prefer it to be / explicit via a setting for now. /  / The Binder is responsible for URL patterns, URL reversals, and object / lookups.
* set wiki.__version__
* moved right travis config into place
* Remove spaces
* Fix pip install in travis config
* Add notification to IRC channel
* Add travis config
* Initial Commit
