This release includes the following:

* convert form to bootstrap
* remove reference to uniform
* removed unused template
* Bumped version for next release
* Removed default values of one from ProposalResult denormalized fields /  / The original default value of one assumed ProposalResult was being created / when a Review was created which meant a comment and a vote was made. This is / no longer the case from changes after the original change and has caused off / by one errors in the denormalized count.
