Download: <https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/d/django-stripe-payments/django-stripe-payments-2.0b22.tar.gz>

This release includes the following:

* 2.0b22
* Update _cancel_form.html /  / Fix a small grammar mistake.
* Update installation.rst /  / I noticed that you use request.user in some of your templates, which will not work without the request context preprocessor.
