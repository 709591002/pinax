This release includes the following:

* bump version
* include user rating in reviews
* only use body outer so we can reliably wrap all pages in an outside container
* Fixed bug in review deletion /  / When a review was not the latest it would cause a bug on deletion of the / latest. We changed the logic to work with the latest vote versus the previous / to fix this issue. Now all review deletion ensure a consistent latest vote / state.
