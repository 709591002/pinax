* Rename agora to pinax-forums and move to Pinax organization /  / agora was developed a while ago for Eldarion clients who permitted us / open sourcing it. We open sourced it under the name agora as Eldarion / open source but from the start it was considered part of Pinax. /  / Since we have yet to release a package and are preparing to do so, it / made sense to relocate the package under the Pinax organization and / rename it to something so itâ€™s clearly a Pinax app.
